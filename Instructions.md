# How To Play

This game can be played between two players only, say **_A_** and **_B_**.
So, one of you will play the roll of server, say **_A_**, while the other will play the role of client, say **_B_**.
What that means is, **_A_** will run the *TTTServer.jar* file, while **_B_** will run the *TTTClient.jar* file.

## Player A
**(1)** Just click on your **TTTServer.jar** executable and you will see something like the following:

**(2)** Just click on **connect** button and you will see something like the following:

Now, your friend should know your **IP-address**, if not then give it to her/him and ask them to follow their instructions.

**(3)** When your friend has entered your **IP-address**, then you can click **OK** and you are good to go. :)

## Player B
**(1)** Just click on your **TTTClient.jar** executable and you will see something like the following:

**(2)** Just click on **connect** button and you will see something like the following:

**(3)** Enter your friends **IP-address** and click **OK**.

Thats it! Now, look at the top-left corner to see, if its your turn or not and also you can **reset** the game whenever you want.

Have FUN! :)
