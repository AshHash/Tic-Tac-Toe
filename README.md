# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple Java based GUI networked game. In the *executable* directory, there are two executable-jar files.
With these two files, you and your friend can play **Tic Tac Toe** from anywhere in the world. 
The only thing that it requires is *java* to be installed in your system.

Have FUN!!! :)
